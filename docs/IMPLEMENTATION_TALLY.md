# Implementation Tally — 2026-10-07

## Completed and tested

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Build and Paper 26.2-130 packaging | Complete; Java 25 plugin build passes |
| Durable wallet ledger | Complete for single-server file persistence; atomic replacement, rollback, idempotency |
| Z.com PostgreSQL contract | Prepared: TLS-validated environment contract and wallet/transfer schema; live adapter is not yet wired |
| `/wallet`, `/balance`, `/pay` | Complete; `/pay` requires an online target and whole positive TMT |
| Persistent class choice | Complete; `/class choose` is permanent and saved |
| Hall of Tadhana design | Implemented as a configurable, disabled-by-default Hall contract with `/class hall`, safe coordinates, five booth plan, odds/confirmation/reveal flow documentation |
| Claims boundary | Implemented with provider-neutral contract and fail-closed default |
| Mob kill bounties | All supported common passive, hostile, aquatic, elite, and boss mobs have server-side fallback bounties; config overrides are supported |
| Anti-monopoly bounty controls | Complete: low bounty schedule, chunk/hour diminishing, grinder rate reset per minute, player cap, server cap, and 20% player-share cap |
| Anti-entity cramming | Complete: loaded chunks are checked every configured interval; 15 non-player living mobs triggers removal, with named/tamed protection enabled by default |
| Route skill catalog | Complete data-driven registry: 5 playable classes × 5 route tiers × 3 skills = 75 definitions |
| Subclass catalog | Complete data-driven registry: 5 classes × 9 domains × 3 tiers = 135 definitions / 270 subclass skill slots |
| Skill runtime | Generic mana/cooldown runtime accepts every catalog definition; `/skills` reports the selected class catalog |
| Class runtime | Permanent class selection and basic server listeners are active; full class-specific effect breadth remains |
| Season clock and route roll | Core logic complete; durable route repository and Hall database reveal remain |
| Quest progress | Core logic and mob payout path complete; full quest board/reward orchestration remains |
| Signed orbs and pricing | Core signing, expiry, price scaling, and daily cap complete; seller/claim box remains |
| Boombai math | Interest cap, repayment split, credit score complete; loan storage/UI/collections remain |
| Leveling math | XP and stage boundaries complete; persistent player progression/effects remain |

## “Remove all risk” reality check

No online server can have zero risk. This pass removes the identified implementation loopholes, but live hosting still requires backups, least-privilege database credentials, a real claims provider, staging tests, monitoring, and rollback procedures. Destructive anti-cramming is intentionally protected for named/tamed mobs by default to avoid deleting player pets or tagged content.

## Still incomplete

The full prompt remains incomplete in these high-scope areas: real claims-plugin adapter, live Z.com PostgreSQL adapter/migration execution, transaction history/audit dashboard, full effect implementation for all generated skills, durable route/subclass/player progression, orb seller atomic purchase UI, Boombai loan lifecycle, bank/central bank, full quests, zones/fatigue, ascension/Soul Gods, market/contracts/companies, opt-in PvP, teleport/homes, moderation/admin dashboards, Geyser/Floodgate forms, and manual WitherHosting QA.

## Loophole tally

- Fixed: persistence loss, failed-write mutation, missing runtime dependency, unrestricted remote control defaults, implicit EULA acceptance, client minting surface, duplicate payments, insufficient-mana cooldown abuse, unrestricted destructive class path, mob grinder/named/AFK/spawner over-rewarding, daily mint runaway, one-player bounty monopoly, permanent grinder counter accumulation, and unsafe Hall coordinate guessing.
- Remaining high risk: fail-closed claims means restricted wood/ore breaks are unavailable until a provider adapter is installed; file-backed storage is not suitable for multiple servers; Z.com is not live-wired; no transaction journal/audit viewer; no live Paper test server; and no Bedrock QA.
